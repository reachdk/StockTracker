# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the modernization of an existing Python-based stock tracking system. The current system monitors portfolio performance and sends email alerts when certain thresholds are breached, but suffers from code duplication, security issues, poor error handling, and lack of proper testing. The modernization will transform it into a robust, secure, and maintainable application with proper configuration management, comprehensive testing, and improved architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want a secure and configurable stock tracking system, so that I can monitor my investments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables and configuration files
2. WHEN sensitive credentials are needed THEN the system SHALL retrieve them from secure environment variables, not hardcoded values
3. WHEN configuration is invalid or missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fail gracefully
4. IF a configuration file is provided THEN the system SHALL validate all required settings before execution
5. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL create necessary directories automatically if they don't exist

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and error handling, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log appropriate information with timestamps and severity levels
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information without crashing
3. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL create daily log files in a dedicated logs directory
4. IF an API call fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and log all attempts
5. WHEN processing multiple stocks THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining stocks if one fails

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured codebase with proper separation of concerns, so that the system is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the code THEN there SHALL be separate classes for different responsibilities (tracking, email, configuration)
2. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL support extension without modifying existing core functionality
3. WHEN duplicate functionality exists THEN it SHALL be consolidated into reusable components
4. IF new data sources are needed THEN the system SHALL support pluggable data providers
5. WHEN the system processes data THEN it SHALL use consistent data validation and error handling patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want reliable email notifications with rich formatting, so that I can quickly understand alert severity and take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN threshold breaches occur THEN the system SHALL send formatted email alerts with clear categorization
2. WHEN multiple alert types trigger THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single well-organized email
3. WHEN emails are sent THEN they SHALL include both plain text and HTML versions for better readability
4. IF email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and optionally retry
5. WHEN alerts are generated THEN they SHALL include relevant context like percentage drops and time since peak

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can ensure system reliability and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL have corresponding unit tests with at least 80% coverage
2. WHEN external APIs are used THEN tests SHALL use mocks to avoid dependencies on external services
3. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL verify end-to-end functionality with test data
4. IF configuration changes THEN tests SHALL verify that invalid configurations are properly rejected
5. WHEN the test suite runs THEN it SHALL complete in under 30 seconds for rapid feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want proper dependency management and deployment configuration, so that the system can be reliably deployed and maintained in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN all dependencies SHALL be clearly specified in a requirements file
2. WHEN deploying the system THEN it SHALL include proper environment configuration templates
3. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL support both development and production configurations
4. IF the system needs scheduling THEN it SHALL include example cron job configurations
5. WHEN packaging the application THEN it SHALL include proper entry points and installation scripts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want flexible stock data management, so that I can easily add, remove, or modify tracked investments and their alert thresholds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new stocks THEN the system SHALL automatically initialize them with default settings
2. WHEN removing stocks from input files THEN the system SHALL clean up orphaned tracking data
3. WHEN stock tolerance levels need adjustment THEN the system SHALL support per-stock threshold configuration
4. IF stock data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL skip invalid entries and continue processing others
5. WHEN processing investment files THEN the system SHALL handle multiple CSV formats gracefully

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system user, I want reliable data fetching with fallback mechanisms, so that temporary API issues don't prevent me from getting stock updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching stock data THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic for failed API calls
2. WHEN API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL respect rate limiting and retry after appropriate delays
3. WHEN some stocks fail to update THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining stocks
4. IF all API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log the issue and send a notification about the failure
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle timeouts and connection errors

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the system to follow security best practices, so that my financial data and credentials remain protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling API keys THEN the system SHALL never log or expose them in plain text
2. WHEN storing configuration THEN sensitive values SHALL be kept in environment variables only
3. WHEN processing data files THEN the system SHALL validate input to prevent injection attacks
4. IF temporary files are created THEN they SHALL be properly cleaned up after use
5. WHEN sending emails THEN the system SHALL use secure connections and validate recipient addresses

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want performance monitoring and optimization, so that the system runs efficiently even with large portfolios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large portfolios THEN the system SHALL batch API requests efficiently
2. WHEN calculating alerts THEN the system SHALL process stocks in parallel where possible
3. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL complete processing within reasonable time limits
4. IF memory usage becomes excessive THEN the system SHALL process data in chunks
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL log timing information for analysis
